# Back-End Developer Capstone Project (Full Stack)

This project is my **capstone for the Meta Back-End Developer Professional Certificate**  
I built it as a **full-stack Django application**, implementing **both the backend and the frontend** to create a fully functional, professional web application.  

The project demonstrates my ability to **design databases, implement backend logic, handle user interactions, and create dynamic frontend views** — all within a single Django project.



## Tech Stack

- **Python 3.x** – core programming language  
- **Django** – backend framework and frontend templating  
- **SQLite** – relational database  
- **Git & GitHub** – version control  



## What I Built

- **Full-Stack Application**
  - Backend with Django models, views, and forms  
  - Frontend with Django templates, HTML, and CSS  
  - CRUD functionality for key entities  

- **Models and Database**
  - Well-structured relational database  
  - Proper model relationships with migrations  

- **Frontend Views**
  - Interactive pages using Django templates  
  - Forms for creating, updating, and deleting data  
  - Dynamic content rendering  

- **Admin Interface**
  - Configured Django admin to manage data efficiently  
  - Easy-to-use dashboard for monitoring entities  

- **Project Structure**
  - Organized into Django apps with clear separation of concerns
